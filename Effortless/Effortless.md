# Effortless

* When you simply can’t try any harder, it’s time to find a different path.

## Part I: Effortless State

* When our brains are at full capacity, everything feels harder. Fatigueslows us down. Outdated assumptions and emotions make new information harder to process.
* So the first step toward making things more effortless is to clear theclutter in our heads and our hearts.
* It’s when you feel rested, at peace, and focused.
* You’re fully present in the moment.


## Part II: Effortless Action

* Simplifying the process to make the work itself easier to do.


## Part III: Effortless Results

* There are two types of results: linear and residual.
* Efforts that yield a one-time benefit, bring linear results. It’s a one-to-one ratio;
* Residual results: you put in the effort once and reap the benefits ssagain and again.

# Effortless State - Part 1

* When your brain is filled with clutter—like outdated assumptions, negative emotions, and toxic thought patterns—you have less mental energy available to perform what’s mostessential. A concept in cognitive psychology known as perceptual load theory.

* When you return to your Effortless State, you feel lighter, in the two senses of the word. First, you feel less heavy—unburdened. You aren’tas weighed down. Suddenly you have more energy. You are able to do what matters most with ease.

## CHAPTER 1: INVERT -- What If This Could Be Easy?

* “Is there an easier way?”

### Hard Work May Not Be Well Named

* All too often, we sacrifice our time, our energy, and even our sanity, almost believing that sacrifice is essential in and of itself.
modern life has created a false dichotomy between things that are “essential and hard” and things that are “easy and trivial.” (Natural law)

* Trivial things are easy. Important things are hard.

* “It won’t be easy, but it’s worth it”

* “It’s going to be really hard to make that happen, but we should try.”

* We don’t even pause to consider that something important and valuable could be made easy.

* What if the biggest thing keeping us from doing what matters is thefalse assumption that it has to take tremendous effort? What if,instead, we considered the possibility that the reason something feelshard is that we haven’t yet found the easier way to do it?

### The Path of Least Effort

* What if, instead of asking, “How can I tackle this really hard but essentialproject?,” we simply inverted the question and asked, “What if thisessential project could be made easy?”

### How to Try Too Hard

* Behind almost every failure of my whole life had made the same error. When I’d failed, it was rarely because Ihadn’t tried hard enough, it was because I’d been trying too hard. 

* In order to overachieve we must also overdo. As a result, we make things harder for ourselves than they need to be.


### Effortless Inversion

* To invert means to turn an assumption or approach upside down, towork backward, to ask, “What if the opposite were true?” Inversion canhelp you discover obvious insights you have missed because you’relooking at the problem from only one point of view. It can highlighterrors in our thinking. It can open our minds to new ways of doingthings.

* Effortless Inversion means looking at problems from the oppositeperspective. It means asking, “What if this could be easy?” It meanslearning to solve problems from a state of focus, clarity, and calm. Itmeans getting good at getting things done by putting in less effort.

* Once we invert the question, even everyday tasks that seem toooverwhelming to tackle become easier.

* When we feel overwhelmed, it may not be because the situation isinherently overwhelming. It may be because we are overcomplicatingsomething in our own heads. Asking the question “What if this could beeasy?” is a way to reset our thinking. It may seem almost impossiblysimple. And that’s exactly why it works.

### Weaken the Impossible

* There’s no question that some goals are incredibly, almost impossibly, hard to achieve. However, even these can sometimes be made less hard, once we find an indirect approach.

### A One-Way Ticket to Easy

* Free of the assumptions that make your problem look hard, you would be surprised how often an easier solution appears.

### Can You Push Something Downhill?

* “I have come to learn that part of the business strategy is to solve the simplest, easiest, and most valuable problem.

* We think that to be extraordinarily successful we have to do the thingsthat are hard and complicated. Instead, we can look for opportunitiesthat are highly valuable and simple and easy.

* When a strategy is so complex that each step feels akin to pushing aboulder up a hill, you should pause. Invert the problem. Ask, “What’sthe simplest way to achieve this result?”

* When we shelve the false assumption that the easier path has to be theinferior path, obstacles fade away. And as these obstacles disappear,we can begin to uncover our Effortless State.

## CHAPTER 2: ENJOY -- What If This Could Be Fun?

* So often we separate important work from trivial play.

* Separating important work from play makes life harder than it needs tobe.

* But essential work can be enjoyable once we put aside the Puritannotion that anything worth doing must entail backbreaking effort. 

* By pairing essential activities with enjoyable ones, we can make tackling even the most tedious and overwhelming tasks moreeffortless.

### Reduce the Lag Indicator

* It’s no secret that many essential activities that are not particularly joyful in the moment produce moments of joy later on. 
  
* But these are all lag indicators—meaning, you experience the reward after the action has taken place, sometimes weeks, months, oryears afterward.

* But essential activities don’t have to be enjoyed only in retrospect. Wecan also experience joy in the activity itself. We simply reduce the lagtime between the action and satisfaction by pairing the essentialactivity with a reward.

* “How can I make calling these people back enjoyable?”

* “There are many experiences in our work and personal life that are boring, mundane, or even stressful. We often feel that we have no options but to endure them or avoid them” 
* “if we can break down the processes into those steps, we may find waysto make the steps more bearable, or better yet, fun.”

* There is power in pairing our most enjoyable activities with our most essential ones.

* How long have you tried to force yourself to do the important but difficultthing through sheer determination, instead of making it fun?

* One leader I have worked with sees running on a treadmill every day asan essential habit. Yet he was inconsistent about it until he paired itwith an enjoyable daily practice he never missed: listening to hisfavorite daily podcast. Now he gets to listen to the podcast only if he iswalking or running on the treadmill. He doesn’t reward himself after hehas finished his workout; he rewards himself during. Ever since hemade this essential practice enjoyable, he has found it easy tocontinue doing it consistently.

### Work Easy, Play Easy

* Don’t underestimate the power of the right soundtrack to ditch thedrudgery and get into a groove.

### Create Building Blocks of Joy

* It’s not just that work and play can co-exist, it’s that they cancomplement each other. Together they make it easier to tap into our creativity and come up with novel ideas and solutions.

### Create Habits with a Soul

* Habits explain “what” you do, but rituals are about “how” you do it.

* Rituals make essential habits easier to sustain by infusing the habits with meaning.

* Our rituals are habits we have put our thumbprint on. Our rituals arehabits with a soul.They have the power to transform a tedious task into an experiencethat creates joy.When we invite joy into our daily routine, we are no longer yearning for the far-off day when it might arrive. That day is always today. When weattach small fragments of wonder to mundane tasks, we are no longerwaiting for the time when we can finally allow ourselves to relax. Thattime is always now. As fun and laughs lighten more of our moments, weare drawn back further toward our natural, playful Effortless State.
