# Effortless

* When you simply can’t try any harder, it’s time to find a different path.

## Part I: Effortless State

* When our brains are at full capacity, everything feels harder. Fatigueslows us down. Outdated assumptions and emotions make new information harder to process.
* So the first step toward making things more effortless is to clear theclutter in our heads and our hearts.
* It’s when you feel rested, at peace, and focused.
* You’re fully present in the moment.


## Part II: Effortless Action

* Simplifying the process to make the work itself easier to do.


## Part III: Effortless Results

* There are two types of results: linear and residual.
* Efforts that yield a one-time benefit, bring linear results. It’s a one-to-one ratio;
* Residual results: you put in the effort once and reap the benefits ssagain and again.

# Effortless State - Part 1

* When your brain is filled with clutter—like outdated assumptions, negative emotions, and toxic thought patterns—you have less mental energy available to perform what’s mostessential. A concept in cognitive psychology known as perceptual load theory.

* When you return to your Effortless State, you feel lighter, in the two senses of the word. First, you feel less heavy—unburdened. You aren’tas weighed down. Suddenly you have more energy. You are able to do what matters most with ease.

## CHAPTER 1: INVERT -- What If This Could Be Easy?

* “Is there an easier way?”

### Hard Work May Not Be Well Named

* All too often, we sacrifice our time, our energy, and even our sanity, almost believing that sacrifice is essential in and of itself.
modern life has created a false dichotomy between things that are “essential and hard” and things that are “easy and trivial.” (Natural law)

* Trivial things are easy. Important things are hard.

* “It won’t be easy, but it’s worth it”

* “It’s going to be really hard to make that happen, but we should try.”

* We don’t even pause to consider that something important and valuable could be made easy.

* What if the biggest thing keeping us from doing what matters is thefalse assumption that it has to take tremendous effort? What if,instead, we considered the possibility that the reason something feelshard is that we haven’t yet found the easier way to do it?

### The Path of Least Effort

* What if, instead of asking, “How can I tackle this really hard but essentialproject?,” we simply inverted the question and asked, “What if thisessential project could be made easy?”

### How to Try Too Hard

* Behind almost every failure of my whole life had made the same error. When I’d failed, it was rarely because Ihadn’t tried hard enough, it was because I’d been trying too hard. 

* In order to overachieve we must also overdo. As a result, we make things harder for ourselves than they need to be.


### Effortless Inversion

* To invert means to turn an assumption or approach upside down, towork backward, to ask, “What if the opposite were true?” Inversion canhelp you discover obvious insights you have missed because you’relooking at the problem from only one point of view. It can highlighterrors in our thinking. It can open our minds to new ways of doingthings.

* Effortless Inversion means looking at problems from the oppositeperspective. It means asking, “What if this could be easy?” It meanslearning to solve problems from a state of focus, clarity, and calm. Itmeans getting good at getting things done by putting in less effort.

* Once we invert the question, even everyday tasks that seem toooverwhelming to tackle become easier.

* When we feel overwhelmed, it may not be because the situation isinherently overwhelming. It may be because we are overcomplicatingsomething in our own heads. Asking the question “What if this could beeasy?” is a way to reset our thinking. It may seem almost impossiblysimple. And that’s exactly why it works.

### Weaken the Impossible

* There’s no question that some goals are incredibly, almost impossibly, hard to achieve. However, even these can sometimes be made less hard, once we find an indirect approach.

### A One-Way Ticket to Easy

* Free of the assumptions that make your problem look hard, you would be surprised how often an easier solution appears.

### Can You Push Something Downhill?

* “I have come to learn that part of the business strategy is to solve the simplest, easiest, and most valuable problem.

* We think that to be extraordinarily successful we have to do the thingsthat are hard and complicated. Instead, we can look for opportunitiesthat are highly valuable and simple and easy.

* When a strategy is so complex that each step feels akin to pushing aboulder up a hill, you should pause. Invert the problem. Ask, “What’sthe simplest way to achieve this result?”

* When we shelve the false assumption that the easier path has to be theinferior path, obstacles fade away. And as these obstacles disappear,we can begin to uncover our Effortless State.

## CHAPTER 2: ENJOY -- What If This Could Be Fun?

* So often we separate important work from trivial play.

* Separating important work from play makes life harder than it needs tobe.

* But essential work can be enjoyable once we put aside the Puritannotion that anything worth doing must entail backbreaking effort. 

* By pairing essential activities with enjoyable ones, we can make tackling even the most tedious and overwhelming tasks moreeffortless.

### Reduce the Lag Indicator

* It’s no secret that many essential activities that are not particularly joyful in the moment produce moments of joy later on. 
  
* But these are all lag indicators—meaning, you experience the reward after the action has taken place, sometimes weeks, months, oryears afterward.

* But essential activities don’t have to be enjoyed only in retrospect. Wecan also experience joy in the activity itself. We simply reduce the lagtime between the action and satisfaction by pairing the essentialactivity with a reward.

* “How can I make calling these people back enjoyable?”

* “There are many experiences in our work and personal life that are boring, mundane, or even stressful. We often feel that we have no options but to endure them or avoid them” 
* “if we can break down the processes into those steps, we may find waysto make the steps more bearable, or better yet, fun.”

* There is power in pairing our most enjoyable activities with our most essential ones.

* How long have you tried to force yourself to do the important but difficultthing through sheer determination, instead of making it fun?

* One leader I have worked with sees running on a treadmill every day asan essential habit. Yet he was inconsistent about it until he paired itwith an enjoyable daily practice he never missed: listening to hisfavorite daily podcast. Now he gets to listen to the podcast only if he iswalking or running on the treadmill. He doesn’t reward himself after hehas finished his workout; he rewards himself during. Ever since hemade this essential practice enjoyable, he has found it easy tocontinue doing it consistently.

### Work Easy, Play Easy

* Don’t underestimate the power of the right soundtrack to ditch thedrudgery and get into a groove.

### Create Building Blocks of Joy

* It’s not just that work and play can co-exist, it’s that they cancomplement each other. Together they make it easier to tap into our creativity and come up with novel ideas and solutions.

### Create Habits with a Soul

* Habits explain “what” you do, but rituals are about “how” you do it.

* Rituals make essential habits easier to sustain by infusing the habits with meaning.

* Our rituals are habits we have put our thumbprint on. Our rituals arehabits with a soul.They have the power to transform a tedious task into an experiencethat creates joy.When we invite joy into our daily routine, we are no longer yearning for the far-off day when it might arrive. That day is always today. When weattach small fragments of wonder to mundane tasks, we are no longerwaiting for the time when we can finally allow ourselves to relax. Thattime is always now. As fun and laughs lighten more of our moments, weare drawn back further toward our natural, playful Effortless State.

## CHAPTER 3: RELEASE -- The Power of Letting Go

* The idea had been added as a “to-do” in my brain three decades before, then had slipped beneath myconsciousness. Evidently, it had been in my head all this time, taking up mental space.

* Do you have any items like this, living rent-free in your mind? Outdatedgoals, suggestions, or ideas that snuck into your brain long ago andtook up permanent residence? Mindsets that have outlived theirusefulness but have been part of you for so long, you barely even notice them?

* Stormtroopers take many forms: regrets that continue to haunt us,grudges we can’t seem to let go of, expectations that were realistic atsome point but are now getting in our way.

* These intruders are like unnecessary applications running in thebackground of your computer, slowing down all its other functionality.At first they might not seem to affect your speed and agility. But asthey keep accumulating, one after another, eventually your operating system starts to run slower.
  
### Focus on What You Have

* When we fall victim to misfortune, it’s hard not to obsess, lament, or complain about all that we have lost.

* Complaining is one of the easiest things to do. It’s so easy many of us do it incessantly: someone is late to meet us, when our neighbors are too loud, there are no parking spaces on the one day we are running late, we watch the news,

* We live in a complaint culture that gets high on expressing outrage:social media, affect us, and give us emotional cancer.

* We start to perceive more injustices in our own lives. Occupying valuable real estate in our brains and hearts.
  
* Have you ever found that the more you complain—and the more you read and hear other people complain—the easier it is to find things to complain about? 
  
* Have you ever found that the more grateful you are, the more you have to be grateful for? Toxic thoughts quickly accumulate.
And the more mental space they occupy, the harder it becomes to return to the When you focus on something you are thankful for, the effect is instant.

* It immediately shifts you from a lack state (regrets, worries about the future, the feeling of being behind) and puts you into a have state (what is going right, what progress you are making, what potentialexists in this moment). It reminds you of all the resources, all theassets, all the skills you have at your disposal—so you can use them tomore easily do what matters most.

* Broaden-and-build theory in psychology: Positive emotions open us to new perspectives and possibilities. Our openness encourages creative ideas and fosters social bonds. They unlock new physical, intellectual, psychological, and social resources. They create “an upward spiral” that improves our odds of coping with the next challenge we face. When we express gratitude to others, we see their faces light up.

* When you focus on what you lack, you lose what you have.

* When you focus on what you have, you get what you lack.

* Complaining, too, creates a self-sustaining cycle. But instead ofmaking it easier to do what matters, this system makes it harder. A “downward spiral.”

* When we experience negative emotions our mindset narrows. We are less open to new ideas and to other people. Making it harder to cope with the very challenges or frustrations.

* A system is self-sustaining if it requires less and lessinvestment of energy over time. Once it’s set in motion, maintaining itbecomes easier, then easy, then eventually effortless. A system with momentum.

### Relieve a Grudge of Its Duties

* Have you ever held on to a grudge against people who hurt you?Wasted precious mental energy being angry, hurt, annoyed, orresentful? How long has the wound been festering? Weeks? Months?Years? Decades?

* We can all let go of the grudges that we have been holding on to, whichhave made it harder to focus on the things we truly care about.

* A good first step we can take is to ask this unusual question: What jobhave I hired this grudge to do?

* We often hire a grudge to fulfill an emotional need that is not currently being met.

* Grudges cost us resources but don’t deliver a satisfying return on our investment. So we must relieve a grudge of its duties.

* Sometimes we hire a grudge to make us feel in control. We try to proveto ourselves and others that we are right and they are wrong. At firstthis can make us feel superior, even powerful. It gives us a sense ofcontrol, but one that is fleeting and false, because in reality a grudge controls you.

* It also keeps us trapped in a never-ending loop of blame, self-righteousness, and self-loathing.

* There are times we hire a grudge to give us attention. When people hear our story of victimhood, we get their support and sympathy. Behind the sympathy people express, there is also fatigue. This is onereason you always have to find new people to tell your story to. 

* We hire a grudge to protect ourselves. We think that by being wary ofthe person or people who hurt us once, we can protect ourselves frombeing hurt again. We think the grudge creates emotional armor. Butthis too turns out to be a scam. The grudge makes us more vulnerable,more fearful. It becomes harder to trust, to let anybody in.

### Accept What You Can’t Control

* “When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time”

* When we let go of our need to punish those who’ve hurt us, it’s not the culprit who is freed. We are freed.

## CHAPTER 4: REST -- The Art of Doing Nothing

### Learning to Relax

* doing nothing is painfully hard.

* Studies show that peak physical and mental performance requires a rhythm of exerting and renewing energy.

* “individuals must avoid exhaustion and must limit practice to an amount from which they can completelyrecover on a daily or weekly basis.”

* Have you ever pushed yourself so far past the point of exhaustion one day that you wake up the next morning utterly depleted and need the entire day to rest?

* Follow this simple rule: Do not do more today than you can completely recover from today. Do not do more this week than you can completelyrecover from this week.

* We can miss the signs that we’ve reached the end of an energy cycle.We can ignore the loss of focus, low energy, and fidgeting. We canpower through. We can artificially try to compensate with caffeine orsugar to get past our energy slump. But in the end, our fatigue catchesup with us, making essential work much harder than it needs to be.

### The Power of the One-Minute Pause

* When we are struggling, instead of doubling down on our efforts, wemight consider pausing the action—even for one minute. We don’tneed to fight these natural rhythms. We can flow with them. We canuse them to our advantage. We can alternate between periods ofexertion and renewal.

### Lack of Sleep Is Killing Us

* “Routine nightly sleep for fewer than six hours results in cognitive performance deficits, even if we feel we have adapted to it.”Getting more sleep may be the single greatest gift we can give ourbodies, our minds, and even, it turns out, our bottom lines.

### Go Deep

* "I have seen firsthand that poor sleep quality and/or an insufficient sleepquantity undermines the mindsets of founders,” he says, “makingthem harder to work with and less resilient, which in turn reduces theprobability of startup success.” This is not surprising when youconsider the research showing that sleep problems may underminealertness, creativity, and social competence—all critical qualities forhigh-striving entrepreneurs.

* Deep sleep is crucial to many aspects of health; even if we manage a full night’ssleep, unless enough of that sleep is in a deep state, we’ll suffer fromsleep deprivation. Unlike in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, in thedeep sleep stage, your body and brain waves slow down. This is thestage where information is stored in long-term memory, learning andemotions are processed, the immune system is energized, and thebody recovers. Healthy adults spend an average of 13 to 23 percent oftheir night in deep sleep. So if you sleep for seven hours, thattranslates to just fifty to one hundred minutes in a deep state. Eachminute, in other words, is precious.

* Sleep quality, is how much uninterrupted sleep you get overall. Uninterrupted sleep is when our brain waves and heart ratereach a point that allows physiological and psychological resources tobe restored. This is why we rarely feel rested when we wake up anumber of times at night.

* Maximize both deep sleep and sleep quality, went to bed at the same time every night, turned off digital devices an hour before bed, before turning in, took a hot shower. Who take a bath before bed slept sooner, longer, and better. the key is the timing of the bath or shower: ninety minutes before bedtime.
